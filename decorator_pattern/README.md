# Decorator pattern (Wrapper pattern)

## Intention

- The perpose of the decorator pattern is to modify an object in run time. 
- It can be used when you want polymorphism on instance instead of type. (With the Decorator Pattern, you can add functionality to a single object and leave others like it unmodified.)
